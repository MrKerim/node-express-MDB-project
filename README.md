> Main goal of this file is advancing my backend stack while creating simple projects step by step.
---

### V1

* Simple fecth express and node usage and understanding.
* There we a lot of erros that would have been a lot hard to find.
* Most of the time the error is caused by the function or the web network
* Meaning either I am giving wrong types of arguments
* Or we doesn't accept this ect..

### V2

* Simple data transfer goal of this file is to add an aditional data base
* I am sending data from frontend to backend and in there I am recording the text
* into a txt file, after this step when I need to get the data I just simply read and send it.
* There were some problems however I nailed them.
